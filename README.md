The Challenge

During your internship you will likely be contributing code to ongoing research projects and we want to see your coding ability and approach to solving problems. 

The public transportation demand prediction dataset comprises information about tickets purchased from Mobiticket for 14 routes from “up country” into Nairobi for 7 months. You’ll need a Zindi account to access the data and you can read more about the dataset from the challenge page. Your task is not to participate in the Zindi challenge but answer a series of questions below using the data from (train_revised.csv) file.

    1. Find the top 7 most travelled routes for a Sunday on average, indicate the average of each and rank them in decreasing order
    2. What is the probability that a passenger travelling from Kijauri will take a Shuttle if they depart before 07:30?
    3. The Sequence ‘MK’ appears in a payment reference. Based on the distribution of characters in all the payment references what do you think is the most probable next character (if any)?
